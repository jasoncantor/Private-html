There is general agreement among proponents of climate policy that strategies should be cost effective, address distributional impacts, and incentivize  investments  in  low-carbon  technologies.  Yet disagreements abound regarding additional goals of climate policy design.</p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">Decarbonizing the economy means changing the sources of energy we use, how we transport people and products, how we produce food, and which resources we consume. Yet even among proponents  of  federal  climate  legislation  there  is  strong disagreement regarding policy instruments. Recent proposals for a revenue-neutral carbon tax and a Green New Deal (GND) frame the opposite ends of the debate. On one end, the GND framework treats climate policy as an opportunity to steer the trajectory of the U.S. economy while also correcting social and environmental injustices. Proponents of the most expansive iterations of a GND argue that it is not possible to separate justice and economic considerations from environmental policy. At the other end of the spectrum, revenue- neutral carbon tax proposals reject the creation of new government programs and focus on controlling greenhouse gas emissions rather than the economic and social impacts of the policy.</p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 24pt;text-indent: 20pt;text-align: justify;">This Essay identifies core disputes about the non-emission goals in state and federal climate policy debates that create barriers to legislative consensus. The Essay begins with a comparison of recent proposals to mitigate climate change, including pricing carbon via a carbon market or carbon tax, regulatory measures such as the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, state-based policies, and the GND. It then identifies three conflicts, the resolution of which will</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="452" height="1" alt="image" src="UNC-Law-NewDeal_files/Image_006.png"/></span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s18">∗</span>C.

Deploying low carbon technologies is a critical piece of the climate mitigation puzzle, but stakeholders disagree whether decarbonization strategies should prioritize renewable energy or include technologies such as nuclear or carbon capture. Each policy discussed in this Essay considers some range of social impacts (at minimum, cost increases), but differ significantly about which social impacts to address and the how to address them. The policies also adopt different approaches to the link between fiscal policy and climate  policy,  with  some  generating  revenue  to  fund  new government programs, some returning revenue to U.S. citizens, and some not addressing the issue. The Essay concludes with comments about the early impacts of the GND on the domestic policy debate and opportunities to resolve it.</p><ol id="l1"><li data-list-text="I."><p style="padding-top: 13pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;text-align: left;">Introduction                                 22</p></li><li data-list-text="II."><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;text-align: left;">Defining the Green New Deal                      26</p></li><li data-list-text="III."><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;text-align: left;">The Green New Deal in the Context of U.S.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Climate Policy                              28</p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="A."><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: left;">Pricing Carbon                          <span class="p">29</span></p></li><li data-list-text="B."><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: left;">Clean Air Act Regulations and Clean Energy Targets    <span class="p">31</span></p></li><li data-list-text="C."><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: left;">The Green New Deal                       <span class="p">33</span></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="IV."><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;text-align: left;">What We Talk about when We Talk about Climate</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Policy                                     34</p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="A."><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: left;">Decarbonization as Technology Policy             <span class="p">35</span></p></li><li data-list-text="B."><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: left;">Decarbonization as Social Justice Policy           <span class="p">37</span></p></li><li data-list-text="C."><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: -20pt;text-align: left;">Decarbonization as Fiscal Policy                <span class="p">40</span></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="V."><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: -30pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion                                  41</p></li></ol><ol id="l4"><li data-list-text="I."><p style="padding-top: 30pt;padding-left: 152pt;text-indent: -9pt;text-align: left;">Introduction</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">In 2018, a new coalition of environmental and social justice advocates launched the Green New Deal (GND)—a sweeping framework to mitigate climate change, reduce unemployment, and address other longstanding social justice and environmental challenges.

These proposals focus on controlling a class of pollutants rather than the economic and social impacts of the policy.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">The contrast between the GND and carbon tax proposals highlight a challenge that has long frustrated efforts to decarbonize the economy: some of the most consequential disagreements about climate policy are not simply about the best way to reduce the atmospheric concentration of GHGs. Instead, the conflicts are rooted in fundamentally different views of the role of government. Achieving the broad-based political coalition to move climate change legislation through Congress requires addressing these core conflicts.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">Decarbonizing the economy means changing how we power the economy, transport people and products, produce food, and consume other natural resources. There is general agreement that climate policy should be cost effective, should address distributional impacts, and should  incentivize  investments  in  low  carbon  technologies.  Yet disagreements abound regarding the scope of the problem and the appropriate responses. Should climate policy allow compliance flexibility or mandate emission reductions at each facility subject to the policy?

Should decarbonization policy ensure that new infrastructure does not create long-term  public  health  and  environmental  burdens  for  local communities? Perhaps most fundamentally, is decarbonization about pollution mitigation alone, or should it also address the social impacts resulting from the transition to a low carbon economy?</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">Policy debates often treat these as questions of strategy (in other words, the means of decarbonizing). This Essay argues that the disagreements  reflect  different  views  about  the  core  goals  of decarbonization  rather  than  merely  the  strategies  for  reducing emissions.  Different  stakeholders  expect  fundamentally  different outcomes and define success in sometimes vastly different terms. Some expect climate policy to correct past economic and environmental injustices. Some seek to rigidly define the scope of acceptable energy technologies while others are agnostic regarding technology choices as long as the policy results in lower overall GHG emissions over time. Some prioritize reducing economic burdens on the new policy but give less attention to other social goals.<span class="s21">5</span></p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">Proponents of the most expansive iterations of a GND argue that it is not possible to separate justice and economic considerations from environmental policy, and that politics and equity require addressing the economic impacts of climate policy as part of a comprehensive decarbonization effort.<span class="s21">6 </span>Decarbonizing the economy necessarily means that some jobs will disappear and some communities will suffer economic blows.

Climate change is such a critical threat that a targeted response that has a better  chance  of  collecting  the  necessary  votes in  Congress is  a preferable option. For others, the focus on emissions reflects the view that the critical issue at hand is reducing emissions, not using climate policy  as  a  legislative  vehicle  to  tackle  a  host  of  other  societal challenges. In other words, there is not consensus about whether some of the social justice issues included in the GND resolution are issues that government should address and, if they are, whether they should be directly linked to climate change mitigation.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">The Essay begins with a comparison of recent proposals to mitigate climate change, including pricing carbon via a carbon market or carbon tax, regulatory measures such as the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, state-based policies, and the GND.<span class="s21">10 </span>It then discusses three important conflicts, the resolution of which will shape future climate policy developments: the role of decarbonization as technology policy, social justice policy, and fiscal policy. Deploying low carbon technologies is a critical piece of the climate mitigation puzzle, but stakeholders disagree whether decarbonization strategies should prioritize renewable energy or include technologies such as nuclear or carbon capture. Each policy discussed in this Essay considers some range of social impacts (at minimum, cost increases), but they differ significantly about which social impacts to address and the how to address them. The policies adopt different approaches to the link between fiscal policy and climate policy, with some explicitly using revenue to fund new government programs,  some  explicitly  rejecting  creation  of  new  government programs, and some not addressing the issue. The Essay concludes with comments about the early impacts of the GND on the domestic policy debate.

Climate policy  options  are  often  evaluated  based  on  their  impacts  on environmental performance, cost effectiveness, distributional impacts, and political viability. Many stakeholders often rely on economic modeling to assess the costs and impacts of different GHG-reduction pathways and use the results to support a particular emission reduction strategy.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">The GND starts from a different place. Rather than focusing primarily (or exclusively) on pollution abatement, the GND approaches the challenge of climate change as part of a much broader socio- economic challenge.<span class="s21">12 </span>GND advocates argue that the energy system and the economy are at a turning point, and seek to steer both arenas toward a more just, lower carbon future. The strategy combines the need to address climate change, the economic opportunities created by developing and deploying a new generation of energy technologies, the historic exclusion of many communities in environmental policy design, and the need for stable employment with meaningful wages and benefits.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">As of the drafting of this Essay, the GND is a conceptual framework rather than a fully formed legislative proposal. GND proponents in Congress have yet to specify how they would address the challenging fiscal and social tradeoffs inherent in such a broad policy change such as the role of nuclear power, the policy mechanisms to achieve the emission reductions, and how to fund the proposals.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">As a result, the GND acts like a climate version of a Rorschach test, with proponents and opponents seizing on certain details (or lack thereof) to extrapolate what the entire concept stands for, from a call for 100% renewable energy to hyperbolic claims that the GND is a “Trojan Horse for socialism,” or that it will require everyone to become vegetarians and cease all air travel.<span class="s21">13 </span>It is also unclear at this stage</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="452" height="1" alt="image" src="UNC-Law-NewDeal_files/Image_011.png"/></span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">https://perma.cc/KY4K-VPEA; American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, H.R. 2454, 111th Cong., 1st Sess.

If it is a single policy proposal, the success or failure depends on the ability to move a specific legislative package through the U.S. Congress or state legislatures.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">The lack of details did not prevent the idea from breathing new life into the domestic climate policy debate, however. Almost as soon as the GND entered the national conscience, the race was on to define it.

Coupling a price on carbon with compliance flexibility allows firms with high abatement costs to continue emitting GHGs and pay the price (by purchasing cap- and-trade allowances or paying the carbon tax). Firms with lower abatement costs may reduce their emissions and thus avoid paying the carbon price (by avoiding the carbon tax or the need to purchase allowances, or by selling the allowance in a carbon market). Market- based policies are generally agnostic regarding whether individual facilities reduce emissions or pay the carbon price. As long as the emissions cap or carbon tax are set at an appropriate level, overall emissions should drop over time.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">The 2009 American Clean Energy and Security Act (Waxman– Markey Bill), introduced by then-Representatives Henry Waxman and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="452" height="1" alt="image" src="UNC-Law-NewDeal_files/Image_014.png"/></span></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="28"><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 10pt;line-height: 108%;text-align: justify;">Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act of 2018, H.R. 7173, 115th Cong., 2d Sess. §§ 9902, 9512 (2018); Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act of 2018, S. 3791,</p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">115th Cong., 2d Sess. §§ 9902, 9512 (2018).</p></li><li data-list-text="29"><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 10pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">This list only scratches the surface of options for reducing emissions.

Decarbonization may function as energy policy by influencing the means by which we produce and consume energy. Decarbonization may function as transportation policy by changing automobile technologies, altering transportation options, or lowering the carbon content of fuels.<span class="s21">57  </span>Carbon offset markets may function as agriculture policy, providing incentives for farmers to adopt new practices or set aside land for conservation. These are explicit strategies designed to target major sources of GHG emissions.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">Decarbonization may take the form of international trade policy.

The “renewables versus clean” distinction turns on whether a low carbon  future  should  include  nuclear  energy  or  fossil  fuel-fired generation with carbon capture.<span class="s21">63 </span>A growing number of states are implementing renewable or clean energy mandates. This is already a major factor in GND discussions and could sway some stakeholders’ opinions about the wisdom of the GND approach generally.<span class="s21">64 </span>States are also  taking  different  approaches  to  the  question,  with  some implementing aggressive new renewable energy mandates and others adopting clean energy mandates.<span class="s21">65</span></p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">A key trait of carbon taxes and carbon markets is compliance flexibility.

Even though carbon pricing schemes do not mandate renewable energy, they create favorable economic conditions for lower carbon forms of energy. They may operate in parallel with technology incentives or mandates.

The social justice provisions in some of the programs included in this section— particularly the Clean Power Plan—are limited because the authorizing statute focuses on pollution control but does not authorize the agency to directly address justice concerns. Others, such as RGGI, are limited because they focus on one sector. The recent carbon tax, cap-and- dividend, and GND proposals are not constrained by preexisting policy constraints. Instead, they demonstrate the continuing disagreements regarding the meaning of social justice, the role of climate policy in addressing the justice needs, and the proper balance between social justice concerns and other climate policy goals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="452" height="1" alt="image" src="UNC-Law-NewDeal_files/Image_022.png"/></span></p></li></ol></li><li data-list-text="75"><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 10pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Current examples of technology innovation policies that support GHG emission- reduction goals include the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency- Energy (ARPA-E), renewable energy tax credits, and numerous funding opportunities for technology research and development. <i>See, e.g.</i>, ARPA-E.<span class="s22">GOV</span>, https://perma.cc/AKS9- H7B9 (last visited Jan. 25, 2020); <i>2017 Renewable Energy Tax Credits</i>, E<span class="s22">NERGY </span>S<span class="s22">TAR</span>, https://perma.cc/UP5J-UCDB (last visited Jan. 25, 2020).</p></li><li data-list-text="76"><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;"><i>See </i>B<span class="s22">LUMENTHAL</span>, <i>supra </i>note 7, at 3–7.</p></li><li data-list-text="77"><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -11pt;text-align: left;">Ocasio-Cortez–Markey GND Resolution, <i>supra </i>note 18, at 5.</p></li><li data-list-text="78"><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 10pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Darren McCauley &amp; Raphael Heffron, <i>Just Transition: Integrating Climate, Energy and Environmental Justice</i>, E<span class="s22">NERGY </span>P<span class="s22">OL</span>’<span class="s22">Y</span>, Aug. 2018, at 1.</p></li><li data-list-text="79"><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Alice Kaswan, <i>Expanding Environmental Justice to Achieve a Just Transition</i>,</p><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">R<span class="s22">EGULATORY </span>R<span class="s22">EVIEW </span>(Sept. 26, 2018), https://perma.cc/2WS2-AP5J.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">As noted previously, the Waxman–Markey Bill included numerous provisions to address the impacts of higher energy prices on low income citizens, the geographic disparities in the energy mix, and the inevitable job losses that would result from a move to a lower carbon economy.<span class="s21">80 </span>Some stakeholders criticized the Waxman–Markey approach due to its reliance on emissions trading.<span class="s21">81  </span>The bill sought to steer the U.S. economy to a low carbon future, but it did not include specific provisions to ensure that the energy transition reduced pollution in burdened communities.

In contrast, funding new climate and social policies through general tax revenues, or funding them with government revenues at all, may prove to be a dealbreaker for advocates of revenue-neutral policies.

It reframes climate change as a critical social challenge rather than simply an environmental problem. Expanding the policy goals GHG reductions could allow engaging different constituencies with different arguments. Stakeholders could see tangible benefits in terms of jobs, reduced burdens from local pollution (due to retiring fossil fuel-fired power plants), and greater opportunities for directing the future of their respective communities (via the just transition emphasis).</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">An important question for GND proponents is whether they will insist on achieving all of the goals at one time. The strategic choice to present the GND as a package of general ideas rather than specific policy proposals creates the opportunity to find consensus among supporters of climate policy. The original New Deal did not come about via one statute and it is likely that any elements of the GND that become law would do so through different statutes, as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">GND proponents may be able to find common ground on some provisions while agreeing to hold other issues for later debates. For example, carbon pricing can play a role in a broader social and environmental policy framework or it can be deployed in a narrower manner focusing on a particular sector or in a policy approach that focuses solely, or primarily, at carbon pollution. A conservative think tank argues for incorporating a carbon tax into the GND,<span class="s21">105 </span>and a former  Obama  Administration  official  argues  that  a  carbon  tax approach is “the original GND.”<span class="s21">106 </span>The proponents of the CLC Carbon Dividend Plan or the GND may still engage in discussions about the merits of carbon pricing and potentially reach agreement on at least one aspect of a comprehensive climate mitigation strategy. Other coalitions could emerge to pursue other social justice and environmental goals.</p><p style="padding-left: 14pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">There  is  also  an  inherent  tension  between  the  rapid decarbonization  called  for  in  the  GND,  inclusive  community participation, environmental protection, and procedural and corrective justice goals.<span class="s21">107 </span>How willing would GND proponents be to compromise</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="452" height="1" alt="image" src="UNC-Law-NewDeal_files/Image_027.png"/></span></p></li><li data-list-text="104"><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">Ocasio-Cortez–Markey GND Resolution, <i>supra </i>note 18.</p></li><li data-list-text="105"><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 7pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Ed Dolan, <i>A Carbon Tax Should Be the Centerpiece of the GND</i>, N<span class="s22">ISKANEN </span>C<span class="s22">TR</span>.

Involving local communities in decisions that will affect their futures is important, but it is also time- consuming. If urgent action is the priority, that tension must be addressed.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">But the hard questions are not reserved only for GND proponents. Climate policies, including a revenue neutral carbon tax, aim to speed the transition to clean energy technologies. People are already losing jobs throughout the coal value chain—coal mines, coal-fired power plants, and rail.<span class="s21">108 </span>If alternatives to the GND do not recognize that the energy transition is an economic transition, they will likely continue to struggle with building the types of coalitions necessary to adopt new legislation. Furthermore, if they do manage to achieve new legislation, relying on a carbon price may be insufficient to support the type of research and development necessary to achieve breakthrough energy technologies.</p><p style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 21pt;text-align: justify;">These disagreements do not alter the fundamental facts about climate change. Global GHG emissions continue to rise, and a steady stream of academic studies point to alarming impacts of unabated emission increases.<span class="s21">109 </span>The failure to address climate change will undoubtedly create profound social impacts. While stakeholders may support different end goals, the emergence of the GND and new carbon pricing proposals are a refreshing change from the stalemate of the past decade and could create opportunities to resolve the disputes that have created barriers to an effective national climate policy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 12pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="452" height="1" alt="image" src="UNC-Law-NewDeal_files/Image_028.png"/></span></p></li><li data-list-text="108"><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">B<span class="s22">LUMENTHAL</span>, <i>supra </i>note 7.</p></li><li data-list-text="109"><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 36pt;text-indent: -14pt;text-align: left;">IPCC S<span class="s22">PECIAL </span>R<span class="s22">EPORT ON </span>G<span class="s22">LOBAL </span>W<span class="s22">ARMING OF </span>1.5°C (Valerie Masson-Delmotte et</p></li></ol><p class="s19" style="padding-left: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">al. eds., 2018).</p></body></html>
